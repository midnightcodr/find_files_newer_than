## About
Wrote this routine because one of the projects that I am working on requires parsing files on a ftp server and fortunately enough the file names contain timestamps in yyyymmdd format. $last_file would be the last file to be processed and the record will be stored somewhere (currently using db) to avoid parsing the same files repeatedly.
